## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Understanding the project structure will help you contribute effectively:

```
discord-moderation-bot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bot.py              # Main bot file with event handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py           # Configuration and constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # Git ignore patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.example        # Environment variables template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md    # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE           # MIT License
```

### Key Components

- **`bot.py`**: Main bot logic, event handlers, and cog loading
- **`config.py`**: Centralized configuration, colors, emojis, and settings
- **Cogs**: Command groups organized by functionality (Moderation, Information, Help)

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, please test:

1. **All existing commands** still work
2. **New commands** work as expected
3. **Permission checks** are working
4. **Error handling** works properly
5. **Bot startup** and shutdown

### Test Server

Consider setting up a test Discord server for development:

1. Create a private Discord server
2. Add your bot with minimal permissions
3. Test commands with different permission levels
4. Use test accounts for different scenarios

- **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?

### Review Timeline

- **Initial review**: Within 48 hours

The `/kick` command fails when trying to kick a member with higher roles.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Create a member with a role higher than the bot
2. Try to kick them with `/kick`
3. Bot responds with error

**Expected Behavior**
Bot should respond with permission error message.

**Actual Behavior**
Bot crashes with AttributeError.

**Error Message**
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'top_role'
```

## üí° Feature Requests

### Good Feature Requests Include

- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** and why it's needed

- **Alternatives considered**
- **Additional context**

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
**Feature Description**
Add a `/warn` command to warn users without punishment.

**Use Case**
Moderators need a way to warn users for minor infractions without kicking/banning.

**Proposed Implementation**
- Store warnings in a simple JSON file
- Add `/warn`, `/warnings`, and `/clearwarnings` commands
- Show warning count in userinfo

**Alternatives**
- Use timeout for warnings
- Create a separate warning bot

**Additional Context**
This would help with progressive moderation and reduce false positives.
